# üéØ Dot Product Calculator in Python

A lightweight and educational Python utility for computing the **dot product** of two vectors. This project showcases two clean and effective methods ‚Äî one classic and one Pythonic ‚Äî to help you master vector operations in pure Python.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìå **Dot Product Computation** for 1D vectors
- üí° **Two Implementation Styles**:
  - Classic loop-based approach with intermediate products
  - Elegant one-liner using `zip()` and `sum()`
- üßº **Pure Python** ‚Äì No external libraries
- üß† **Great for Learning** ‚Äì Understand both step-by-step and idiomatic Python

## üöÄ What Is the Dot Product?

The **dot product** (or scalar product) of two equal-length vectors is the sum of the products of corresponding entries.  
Mathematically:

```

dot(v1, v2) = v1[0]*v2[0] + v1[1]*v2[1] + ... + v1[n]*v2[n]

```

---

## üß∞ Method 1 ‚Äì Step-by-Step Loop with Tracking

> Ideal for beginners and educators who want to see all operations.

‚úÖ **Example**:

```python
v1 = [1, 2, 3]
v2 = [4, 5, 6]
print(dot(v1, v2))  # Output: 32
```

---

## üß™ Method 2 ‚Äì Pythonic List Comprehension

> Fast, clean, and expressive using built-in functions.

‚úÖ **Example**:

```python
v1 = [7, 8]
v2 = [9, 10]
print(dot(v1, v2))  # Output: 7*9 + 8*10 = 143
```

## üß† Performance & Notes

| Method                 | Style       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Loop-Based             | Educational | O(n)            | O(n) (stores intermediate products) |
| Pythonic Comprehension | Concise     | O(n)            | O(1) (no extra storage)             |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:

- Vectors must be the **same length**.
- No built-in error checking is implemented.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Test case

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    v1 = [1, 3, -5]
    v2 = [4, -2, -1]
    print(dot(v1, v2))  # Output: 1*4 + 3*(-2) + (-5)*(-1) = 3
```

---

## üéì Educational Use Case

This tool is perfect for:

- Linear algebra tutorials
- High school or college coding exercises
- AI/ML vector math demos
- Embedded systems needing lightweight math functions

---

## ü§ù Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:

- Adding error handling (e.g., unequal lengths)
- Supporting multidimensional arrays
- Writing test cases with `unittest` or `pytest`

# üî¢ Matrix Multiplication Utility in Python

A compact and flexible Python module that demonstrates two efficient techniques for performing **matrix multiplication**. Whether you're a student, developer, or educator, this tool is perfect for learning and integrating linear algebra operations into your projects.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üßÆ **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two 2D lists (matrices) in pure Python.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Two Implementations**:
  - **Nested Loop Approach** (classic, educational)
  - **List Comprehension Approach** (Pythonic and concise)
- üí° **No Dependencies**: Built with pure Python ‚Äî no NumPy required!
- üìö **Great for Learning**: Understand both fundamental and modern Python styles.

---

## üìå Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Two valid matrices where the **number of columns in A equals the number of rows in B**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Method 1 ‚Äî Classic Nested Loop Implementation

> A step-by-step approach using explicit loops for clarity and control.

‚úÖ **Example**:

```python
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
print(array_mult(A, B))  # Output: [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Method 2 ‚Äî List Comprehension Style (Concise & Pythonic)

> Elegant and faster for small to medium matrices using `zip` and comprehensions.

‚úÖ **Example**:

```python
A = [[2, 3], [4, 5]]
B = [[6, 7], [8, 9]]
print(array_mult(A, B))  # Output: [[36, 41], [64, 73]]
```

## üß† Performance & Notes

| Method             | Style            | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Nested Loops       | Classic          | O(n √ó m √ó p)    | O(n √ó p)         |
| List Comprehension | Pythonic & Clean | O(n √ó m √ó p)    | O(n √ó p)         |

- `A`: n √ó m matrix
- `B`: m √ó p matrix
- Result: n √ó p matrix

üìù **Note**: The function assumes all rows are of equal length (well-formed matrices). No internal validation is performed for mismatched sizes.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Test case

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    B = [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]

    print(array_mult(A, B))
    # Output: [[58, 64], [139, 154]]
```

## üß™ Suggested Enhancements

- Add matrix validation for robustness.
- Raise exceptions for dimension mismatches.
- Extend for NumPy backend optionally.

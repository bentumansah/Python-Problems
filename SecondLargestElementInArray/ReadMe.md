# ü•à Second Largest Element in an Array (Python)

A compact and educational Python utility showcasing **three distinct approaches** to find the second largest element in an array. Great for coding interviews, algorithm practice, and real-world logic implementations.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Three Implementations**:
  - Double Traversal (Simple and clear)
  - Single Traversal (Optimized)
  - Sorting-based (Straightforward)
- üß† **Great for Learning**: Helps understand trade-offs in algorithm design.
- üß© **No Dependencies**: 100% pure Python.
- üìé **Reusable Code**: Easily integrable into other projects or teaching material.

---

## üîß Method 1 ‚Äì Sorting-Based Approach

> Sort the array, then traverse backward from the second last element to find the second largest.

### ‚úÖ Example 1

```python
arr = [10, 5, 10]
print(getSecondLargest_sorted(arr))  # Output: 5
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è1st Time Complexity

- **O(n log n)**: Due to sorting.
- **Space**: O(1)

---

## ‚ö° Method 2 ‚Äì Double Traversal (Naive)

> Traverse the array twice: once to find the maximum, and once to find the second maximum.

### ‚úÖ Example 2

```python
arr = [10, 10, 10]
print(getSecondLargest_double_traversal(arr))  # Output: -1
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è 2nd Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: Two separate traversals.
- **Space**: O(1)

---

## üîç Method 3 ‚Äì Single Traversal (Optimized)

> Track both the largest and second largest in one pass.

### ‚úÖ Example 3

```python
arr = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
print(getSecondLargest_single_traversal(arr))  # Output: 34
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è 3rd Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: Single traversal.
- **Space**: O(1)

---

## üß† Test case

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]

    print("Double Traversal:", getSecondLargest_double_traversal(arr))
    print("Single Traversal:", getSecondLargest_single_traversal(arr))
    print("Sorted Approach:", getSecondLargest_sorted(arr))
```

---

## üìù Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Assumes integer values**. Modify as needed for floats or other types.
- üìà All methods return `-1` if no second distinct largest element is found.
- üß™ Good practice for sorting, iteration, and logic implementation.

## ü§ù Contributing

Improvements and optimizations are welcome!
Ideas:

- Add input validation.
- Handle arrays with fewer than two elements.
- Use Python's `heapq` or `set` for alternate methods.
